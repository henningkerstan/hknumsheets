% Derives the number of sheets from the number of pages as follows:
% - First divide the number of pages by 2 (floating point div),
% - then add 0.5 to the result and
% - finally truncate it to obtain an integer.
%
% Addition of 0.5 and truncation is used to obtain a ceil function:
% If the number of pages is even, truncation will simply remove the 
% added 0.5. Otherwise, the division result ends with .5 and by adding
% 0.5 one obtains an integer so truncation doesn't change anything.
